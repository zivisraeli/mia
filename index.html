        <span class='title'>About this site </span>
        <span class='content'>My dad and I started this site while in training to become a Therapy dog. "Therapy dogs are dogs that are used to bring comfort and joy to those who are ill or under poor conditions, such as those who have been affected by a natural disaster. Many people are able to connect with dogs and feel the love that they provide, and this has a therapeutic effect on them. Typically, they visit hospitals, schools, hospices, nursing homes and more."<br>
          The intent of this site is to have the patients keeping in touch with me in-between visits. I hope to forge closer relationship with the patient I'll see on a regular basis.

        <span class='title'>About me </span>
        <span class='content'>I was born Aug 6th, 2018. Not certain happened till I was 7 months old but at that point I was wandering the street of Silver Lake with my sister. We grabbed food from dumpster and whatever we found the street. In March we were found by volunteers from
          <a href="https://www.hopeforpaws.org/">Hope For Paws</a> who fed us, bathed us and treated us at the
          <a href="https://veterinarycarecenter.com/">The Veterinary Care Center</a>
          where I was neutered, vaccinated and chipped. <br>
          At this point we were fostered by Jackline from
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PittyParty/"> Pitties and Pals Rescue </a>.
          Was waiting patiently to get adopted. A couple of weeks and Ziv showed up and the rest is history. At this point my life changed for over. I have the best life a bitch can wish for. Love the daily walk routines around my Jewish neighborhood and the visit to Pan Pacific Park where I get to play with my best friends Blue (a deaf Pitbull) and Perl (most playful English Pointer).

        <span class='title'>Am I Vicious?</span>
        <span class='content'>
          We, Pitbulls, do get this bad rap. This is a stereotype that is biased, and nothing can be further from the truth. We are the friendliest and most dedicated companions you would ever find. We are just about the nicest dogs there are. I do get aggressive sometimes when I need to be petted or rubbed. But no physical harm will take place. The worst part you would be covered with saliva head to toe.
