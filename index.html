        <span>My dad and I started this site a few weeks ago right after becoming a Therapy dog. I was born Aug 6th 2019. Not certain whappened till I was 8 months old but at that point I was wondering the street of Silver Lake with my sister. We got food from dumpster and whatever we found the street. In March we were found by volanteris from Hope For Paws fed us, bathed us and treated us at the The Veterinary Care Center. . Word spread aroud the Jackline gave our information to Ziv. And the rest if history. </span>
